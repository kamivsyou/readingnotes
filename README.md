# Reading Notes
## Growth Mindset
**A growth mindset is a mindset a a person has when they are open to everything and willing to try new things in order to learn more about the topic or whatever the challenge is.**
## 1. Go head first at the challenge.
       - Don't let a challenge make you run away from what you want.

## 2. Don't give up ever.
      - Don't let that challenge get in your heard outsmart and overcome it.

## 3. Take your failures as lessons and learn from them.
      - Failing is great as long as I learn from it.

1. user@bash: ls -l /home/ryan
2. total 3
3. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
4. drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
5. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
6. user@bash: 
Line 1 presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).
Lines 2 - 5 are output from running the command. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.
Line 6 presents us with a prompt again. After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command the prompt will be displayed. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running (you will learn later how to deal with this).
Your terminal probably won't have line numbers on it. I have just included them here to make it easier to refer to different parts of the material.

## Notes: 09/02/2021 -
### Git: 
- A version control system. 
- It lets multiple developers work on the same code. 
- A history of changes to your file. 
- The ability to view, apply, and remove those changes. 
- Keep all of your project files in one repository.
### Snapshots in time: 
- Each successive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project.
- Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time.
- Commits only changes a log.
### Keeping track:
- Each commit has a label that points to it.
- HEAD = The label meaning “You Are Here”, Very first Commit.
- You can Also assign messages to commits.
- Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.
### Github: 
- A way to share code with others
- An online place to store your code. (Backup is good!)
- It uses git to help manage your team’s work:
### Repositories: 
- A collection of code.
- A way of grouping code.
- Really large projects might have multiple repositories for different parts of their system(ie: front end vs back end)
